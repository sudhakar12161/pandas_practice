    "# Package overview\n",
    "* pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive.\n",
    "* pandas is built on top of NumPy and is intended to integrate well within a scientific computing environment with many other 3rd party libraries.\n",
    "* Here are just a few of the things that pandas does well:\n",
    "    - Easy handling of missing data (represented as NaN) in floating point as well as non-floating point data\n",
    "    - Size mutability: columns can be inserted and deleted from DataFrame and higher dimensional objects\n",
    "    - Automatic and explicit data alignment: objects can be explicitly aligned to a set of labels, or the user can simply ignore the labels and let Series, DataFrame, etc. automatically align the data for you in computations\n",
    "    - Powerful, flexible group by functionality to perform split-apply-combine operations on data sets, for both aggregating and transforming data\n",
    "    - Make it easy to convert ragged, differently-indexed data in other Python and NumPy data structures into DataFrame objects\n",
    "    - Intelligent label-based slicing, fancy indexing, and subsetting of large data sets\n",
    "    - Intuitive merging and joining data sets\n",
    "    - Flexible reshaping and pivoting of data sets\n",
    "    - Hierarchical labeling of axes (possible to have multiple labels per tick)\n",
    "    - Robust IO tools for loading data from flat files (CSV and delimited), Excel files, databases, and saving / loading data from the ultrafast HDF5 format\n",
    "    - Time series-specific functionality: date range generation and frequency conversion, moving window statistics, date shifting and lagging."
